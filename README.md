# BQN VS Code plugin

This VS Code extension provides language support for [BQN].

It is available on the [Open VSX Registry] and the [VS Code Marketplace].

## Features

### Current

- Syntax highlighting.
- Backslash symbol completion (`\r` -> `‚Üë`) using the [standard BQN keymap], like in the [online REPL].
- File, line, and selection execution in the integrated terminal (from @suhr). This requires having a `bqn` executable in your PATH, or customizing the `bqn.executablePath` setting.

### Planned

- Block context highlighting for symbols like `ùï®` and `ùï£`.
- Inline code execution similar to [nvim-bqn].
- CBQN WASM interpreter bundled with the extension.
